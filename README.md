# Pig-Game-Roll-the-Dice-
It is luck based two-player game made in javascript, HTML, CSS where a player has to roll the dice instinctly as many times as he/she wants and be clever enough to hold the score at the right moment so that it is added in his/her final score as rolling the dice to a 1 would result in loss of score and would shift to the other player. The one to score a 100 the earliest would win. One can always start a new game.
